## Identity

**WSUITS6** is the personal operating system of **Alhassan Osman Wunpini**.  
Builder. Thinker. Student of hard problems.

This is where learning, execution, and long-term systems collide.

I do not chase trends.  
I build skills.  
I document reality.  
I train people who take work seriously.

## What I Do

- Build in public  
- Learn aggressively  
- Design systems that scale  
- Document thinking, not noise  

No entertainment.  
No hype cycles.  
No shortcuts.
